# Timeline of Changes

This project was created for the Rasmussen class Advanced Mobile Web Application Development.

The module 1 assignment asked that we create several wireframes using Bootstrap components. Module 2 asked that we bring the wireframes to life. I created three pages for this assignment. Each has a different layout using Bootstrap components. One page uses a carousel, another uses a jumbotron and multiple columns of text and the final one uses columns and cards to display content. I used a rounded-circle logo on the third navbar. I saw it on a Bootstrap tutorial the other day and thought I'd try that out also.
