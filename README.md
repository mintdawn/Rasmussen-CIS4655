# Timeline of Changes

This project was created for the Rasmussen class Advanced Mobile Web Application Development.

The module 1 assignment asked that we create several wireframes using Bootstrap components. Module 2 asked that we bring the wireframes to life. I created three pages for this assignment. Each has a different layout using Bootstrap components. One page uses a carousel, another uses a jumbotron and multiple columns of text and the final one uses columns and cards to display content. I used a rounded-circle logo on the third navbar. I saw it on a Bootstrap tutorial the other day and thought I'd try that out also.

Module 3 Activity assignment added. This assignment was to create a responsive page based on an illustration provided in class. The page had to have the correct column layout and look decent at any screen size and in any orientation. We were required to use Bootstrap to do this. I have a decent understanding of Bootstrap but, this exercise took that understanding to a deeper level. I am starting to really understand how to use d-block and d-none classes at different break points. The hardest part was getting the row in the center that contains two 6 width columns with nesting columns inside of them to display correctly on iPad. I wanted it to breakdown to just one image and one text block per row, instead of two, on the iPad and then down to everything stacked horizontally when viewed on a smaller device.  I was able to get it to do this in the end.

Module 3 Course Project assignment added. Using on the basic template you created in the Module 02 course project, select ONE navigation bar style, and add it to the home page. Create associated pages that are linked in the navigation, so that when the user clicks on a menu item, the site navigates to a new page. Today I changed a lot of the look of the site and made the theme of the site uniform instead of 3 different layouts. Every page has a header and navigation. I'm still working with various Bootstrap components to learn more about using them. The page display responsively on several different kinds of devices.
