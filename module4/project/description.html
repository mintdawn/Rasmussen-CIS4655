  <h2>Module 4 - Project</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>This is my Module 4 assignment. I got confused with the activity part and created a web page instead of a wireframe page. I based this somewhat off the wireframe I created proactively and the page I created on accident for the activity. This assignment is another practice using Bootstrap components. This assignment asked that we incorporate these components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>At least 3 buttons that have badges. They can be any size you choose, as well as any style.</li>
    <li>At least 2 labels. (I think labels have been replaced by badges now. I used badge.)</li>
    <li>At least 1 jumbotron.</li>
    <li>At least 1 card. The button on the card must link to another page of content.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I could not get the Bootstrap class "card-columns" to be properly responsive for iPad and iPad pro so, I drew code from a codepen masonry layout that is located here: <a href="https://codepen.io/smashtheshell/pen/qRRdvb">https://codepen.io/smashtheshell/pen/qRRdvb</a></p>
