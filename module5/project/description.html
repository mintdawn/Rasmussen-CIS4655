  <h2>Module 5 - Project</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Create one new page in your site that contains a form. Your form must use the Bootstrap framework and styling. Your form must have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>At least 2 text boxes</li>
    <li>At least 1 text area</li>
    <li>At least 1 set of check boxes</li>
    <li>At least 1 set of radios</li>
    <li>At least one dropdown with 3 options</li>
    <li>A submit button</li>
    <li>The form must have form validation to disallow submission when the submit button is clicked.</li>
    <li>The form does not require an action, since form processors were not covered in this course.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I used this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ccGZYRWzs" class="text-warning font-weight-bold">tutorial</a> to help me better understand how custom form validation works.
